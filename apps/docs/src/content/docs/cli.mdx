Cappa provides a focused CLI with commands that mirror the visual regression lifecycle. Each command
operates on the screenshots defined in your `cappa.config.ts` file.

## `cappa capture`

Runs Playwright to render every configured scenario and writes the resulting images to the
configured `outputDir`. Captures can be executed locally or inside a CI environment. Use flags such
as `--log-level` to adjust verbosity when diagnosing flaky tests.

## `cappa review`

Launches an interface for comparing the latest screenshots against the approved baseline. The review
step highlights diffs so you can decide whether the change is expected. Pair it with your preferred
branching strategy to share reviews with teammates.

## `cappa approve`

Promotes the currently reviewed screenshots to the baseline. This command is typically run after a
manual review or as a final step in an automated pipeline when the diffs are accepted.

## `cappa status`

Summarizes the state of your screenshot directory, showing how many files are pending approval and
whether any captures are missing. This is useful for scripting custom checks or reporting in CI.

Tip: combine the commands with npm scripts to make common workflows easy to discover for the rest of
your team.
