The `cappa.config.ts` file controls how screenshots are captured, stored, and reviewed. Config files
export a configuration created with `defineConfig` from `@cappa/core`.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@cappa/core';

export default defineConfig({
  outputDir: 'screenshots',
  storybook: {
    url: 'http://localhost:6006'
  }
});
```

### Key options

- **`outputDir`** – Folder where screenshots and diffs are written.
- **`storybook`** – Configure the Storybook plugin with a URL and stories to target.
- **`plugins`** – Register additional plugins to expand how Cappa discovers pages or state.
- **`commands`** – Expose custom CLI commands for project-specific automation.

### Project structure

Store the config at the root of your repository so that Playwright can resolve relative imports and
so CI jobs can run `cappa` without additional flags. When using workspaces, define workspace-level
scripts that call the CLI from the directory containing the config file.

See the [Plugins](./plugins) guide to learn how to extend Cappa with custom integrations.
