The `cappa.config.ts` file controls how screenshots are captured, stored, and reviewed. Config files
export a configuration created with `defineConfig` from `@cappa/core`.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@cappa/core';
import { cappaPluginStorybook } from '@cappa/plugin-storybook';

export default defineConfig({
  outputDir: 'screenshots',
  plugins: [
    cappaPluginStorybook({
      storybookUrl: 'http://localhost:6006'
    })
  ]
});
```

## outputDir

- **type**: `string`
- **default**: `'screenshots'`

Folder where screenshots and diffs are written.
Cappa will create actual, expected, and diff directories within this folder.

## retries

- **type**: `number`
- **default**: `2`

The number of times to retry a screenshot if it fails. See the [Screenshot retries](screenshot-retries) guide for more information.

## concurrency

- **type**: `number`
- **default**: `1`

The number of parallel browser contexts to use when taking screenshots. Each context can process screenshots independently, significantly speeding up large screenshot runs.

Higher values will consume more system resources (CPU and memory).

## screenshot

Screenshot configuration might get overwritten by plugins or more specific settings, while taking
the screenshot.

### screenshot.viewport

- **type**: `{ width: number; height: number }`
- **default**: `{ width: 1920, height: 1080 }`

The viewport to use for the screenshots.

### screenshot.fullPage

- **type**: `boolean`
- **default**: `true`

Whether to take a full page screenshot. If `false`, the viewport will be used.

## diff

Diff configuration sets different, global comparison settings for the images.

### diff.threshold

- **type**: `number`
- **default**: `0.1`
- **range**: `0-1`

This affects how similar a pixel needs to be to the reference image to be considered the same.

### diff.includeAA

- **type**: `boolean`
- **default**: `false`

Whether to include anti-aliased pixels in the diff count.
For most users this should be false, because it makes comparisons very sensitive to sub-pixel differences of
fonts and other UI elements.

### diff.fastBufferCheck

- **type**: `boolean`
- **default**: `true`

Whether to use a fast buffer comparison for identical images. This is a performance optimization that
skips the slower image comparison algorithm.

### diff.maxDiffPixels

- **type**: `number`
- **default**: `0`

The maximum number of different pixels before the comparison fails.

### diff.maxDiffPercentage

- **type**: `number`
- **default**: `0`
- **range**: `0-100`

The maximum percentage of different pixels before the comparison fails. This is a relative value,
so it is affected by the size of the images. A 100px image with a 10% difference is 10 pixels different,
but a 1000px image with a 10% difference is 100 pixels different. On very large full page screenshots
this can mean that small changes still slip through.

## browser

Browser configuration sets different browser settings for playwright.

### browser.type

- **type**: `'chromium' | 'firefox' | 'webkit'`
- **default**: `'chromium'`

The browser to use for the screenshots.

### browser.headless

- **type**: `boolean`
- **default**: `true`

Whether to run the browser in headless mode.
