description: Install the CLI and configure Cappa to capture your first batch of screenshots.
---

Follow these steps to set up Cappa inside an existing frontend project.

## 1. Install dependencies

Cappa is distributed as a set of packages. Install the CLI alongside the core runtime with your
preferred package manager:

```bash
pnpm add -D @cappa/cli @cappa/core
```

Cappa delegates browser automation to [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). Install the Playwright
browsers if your project has not already done so:

```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

## 2. Create a configuration file

Create a `cappa.config.ts` file in the root of your project and define where screenshots should be
saved:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@cappa/core';

export default defineConfig({
  outputDir: 'screenshots'
});
```

Configuration objects can include additional options like custom commands, plugin settings, and CI
integration hooks. Explore the [Configuration](./configuration) guide for a deeper tour.

## 3. Capture, review, and approve

With the configuration in place you can run the standard workflow:

```bash
# capture screenshots with Playwright
cappa capture

# review diffs in an interactive UI
cappa review

# approve changes and update baselines
cappa approve
```

The CLI keeps track of the working directory so you can review screenshots locally or as part of a
continuous integration job.
