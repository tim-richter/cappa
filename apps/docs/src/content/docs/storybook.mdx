description: Configure Cappa to capture Storybook stories with the official plugin and addon.
---

The `@cappa/plugin-storybook` package bridges Storybook with Cappa's screenshot pipeline. It fetches
stories from a running Storybook instance, opens each story in Playwright, and captures images using
the same comparison workflow as other targets. This guide walks through installing the plugin,
connecting it to Storybook, and fine-tuning how screenshots are generated.

## Install the plugin

Add the Storybook plugin alongside the Cappa core packages inside your project:

```bash
pnpm add -D @cappa/plugin-storybook
```

Next, register the plugin inside `cappa.config.ts` so that the CLI knows how to discover stories. The
`storybookUrl` should point at the running Storybook server.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@cappa/core';
import { cappaPluginStorybook } from '@cappa/plugin-storybook';

export default defineConfig({
  outputDir: 'screenshots',
  plugins: [
    cappaPluginStorybook({
      storybookUrl: 'http://localhost:6006',
    }),
  ],
});
```

You can add additional plugin options to filter the stories that are captured:

- **`includeStories`** – Array of glob patterns to include stories. Stories matching any of these patterns will be included. Patterns can match against story ID, title, name, or full story path (e.g., `["button--*"]`, `["*--primary"]`, `["Button/*"]`).
- **`excludeStories`** – Array of glob patterns to exclude stories. Stories matching any of these patterns will be excluded. Uses the same pattern matching as `includeStories`.
- **`defaultViewport`** – Override the default Playwright viewport when a story does not supply its
  own settings.

## Wire up the Storybook addon

The plugin ships with a Storybook addon that exposes story-level configuration to Cappa. Enable it by
adding `@cappa/plugin-storybook` to the Storybook addons list:

```ts title=".storybook/main.ts"
import type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/react-vite';

const config: StorybookConfig = {
  addons: ['@cappa/plugin-storybook'],
};

export default config;
```

The addon registers a global decorator that collects parameters for each story. If you need to adjust
Storybook's runtime when Cappa is in control, you can use the exported `isCappa` helper in
`.storybook/preview.ts`:

```ts title=".storybook/preview.ts"
import { isCappa } from '@cappa/plugin-storybook/browser';

if (isCappa()) {
  // Disable animations, load mock data, etc.
}
```

## Capture stories

Start Storybook in one terminal and keep it running so the plugin can connect to the `storybookUrl`.
From another terminal, run the Cappa capture command from the directory that contains your config:

```bash
# Terminal 1
pnpm storybook

# Terminal 2
pnpm cappa capture
```

Cappa will fetch the list of stories, load each one in Playwright, and write screenshots, diffs, and
reports to the configured output directory. Pair it with `cappa review` and `cappa approve` to follow
the normal approval workflow.

> You can use `start-server-and-test` to start Storybook and Cappa in one command.
> 
> ```bash
> pnpm start-server-and-test storybook "pnpm cappa capture"
> ```

## Control per-story behaviour

Story-specific parameters can override how Cappa captures each story. Define them in your story file
under `parameters.cappa`.

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `skip` | Skip capturing the story. | `false` |
| `delay` | Wait (in ms) before taking the screenshot. | `null` (no delay) |
| `fullPage` | Capture the full page instead of the viewport. | `true` |
| `mask` | Array of selectors to blur or hide in the screenshot. | `[]` |
| `omitBackground` | Capture the page with a transparent background. | `false` |
| `viewport` | Override the viewport size for the story. | Playwright default |
| `variants` | Additional screenshots to capture with overrides. | `[]` |

```ts title="Button.stories.tsx"
export const Primary = {
  parameters: {
    cappa: {
      delay: 250,
      mask: ['.tooltip'],
      variants: [
        {
          id: 'mobile',
          label: 'Mobile',
          options: { viewport: { width: 375, height: 812 } },
        },
        {
          id: 'dark-mode',
          label: 'Dark mode',
          options: { omitBackground: true },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
};
```

> parameters are usually typed as any in storybook. To provide better types for cappa parameters, you can
> overwrite storybook parameters like this:
>
> ```ts title="stories/types.d.ts"
> import type { CappaStorybookOptions } from "@cappa/plugin-storybook";
> import "@storybook/react-vite"; // replace with your framework
>
> declare module "@storybook/react-vite" { // replace with your framework
>   interface Parameters {
>     cappa?: CappaStorybookOptions;
>   }
> }
> ```

## Variants

You can instruct cappa to capture multiple screenshots of a story, e.g. with different viewport:

```ts title="Button.stories.tsx"
export const Primary = {
  parameters: {
    cappa: {
      variants: [
        {
          id: 'mobile',
          label: 'Mobile',
          options: { viewport: { width: 375, height: 812 } },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
};
```

The `id` is used to identify the variant, and the `label` is used to display the variant in the report.
The `options` are mostly the same as the options for the story, but they are applied to the variant.

The `filename` is the name of the file that will be created for the variant. If not provided, it will be
generated from the story name and the variant id.

### Args

You can override the args for a variant by adding them to the `options.args` property.

```ts title="Button.stories.tsx"
export const Primary = {
  parameters: {
    cappa: {
      variants: [
        {
          id: 'small',
          label: 'Small',
          options: {
            args: {
              size: 'small',
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
};
```

Args only work if your component also is supporting these props AND spreads the args to the component.

## Play function

If your story has a play function, cappa will wait for it to complete before capturing the screenshot.

```ts title="Button.stories.tsx"
export const Primary = {
  play: async ({ canvasElement }) => {
    const canvas = within(canvasElement);
    await userEvent.click(canvas.getByRole("button"));
  },
};
```

This allows you to take interactive screenshots of your stories.
