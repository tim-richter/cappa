Cappa is a Playwright-powered screenshot tool that helps to spot visual regressions early. It
wraps browser automation from Playwright in a workflow tailored for visual reviews so that
you can capture, compare, and approve screenshots for your project.

## Why Cappa?

- **Deliberate review flow.** Run `cappa capture`, `cappa review`, and `cappa approve` to create a
  repeatable approval process that fits continuous delivery pipelines.
- **Extensible by design.** Cappa ships with a plugin system so you can connect Storybook or other
  custom data sources without forking the core tool.
- **Local** Cappa captures screenshots locally and relies on your vcs to track changes.
- **Un-flakable (?)** Cappa takes extra care again flakiness and has multiple mechanisms to circumvent it.

## Core features

Cappa is composed of a lightweight CLI and a composable configuration layer provided by
`@cappa/core`. Together they make it easy to:

1. Define screenshot targets in a `cappa.config.ts` file.
2. Capture images locally or in CI using `cappa capture`.
3. Review diffs in an interactive UI with `cappa review`.
4. Approve changes and sync baselines with `cappa approve`.

Continue to the [Quickstart](/cappa/quickstart) guide to install the packages and run your first capture
cycle.
