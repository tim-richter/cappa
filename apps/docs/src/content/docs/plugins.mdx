Cappa includes a plugin system so teams can adapt the screenshot workflow to their stack.

## Using the Storybook plugin

The official Storybook plugin (`@cappa/plugin-storybook`) connects Storybook stories to Cappa's
capture pipeline. After installing the package, enable it in `cappa.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@cappa/core';
import { storybookPlugin } from '@cappa/plugin-storybook';

export default defineConfig({
  outputDir: 'screenshots',
  plugins: [
    storybookPlugin({
      url: 'http://localhost:6006'
    })
  ]
});
```

Run `cappa capture` while Storybook is running to create screenshots for every selected story. The
plugin is a convenient starting point for integrating Cappa into component libraries.

## Authoring custom plugins

Plugins can hook into the capture lifecycle to register new pages, mutate context, or send
notifications. Start by creating a function that returns an object conforming to the plugin API from
`@cappa/core`.

```ts
import type { CappaPlugin } from '@cappa/core';

export function myPlugin(): CappaPlugin {
  return {
    name: 'my-plugin',
    async onBeforeCapture({ page }) {
      await page.addStyleTag({ content: ':root { color-scheme: dark; }' });
    }
  };
}
```

Register the plugin in `cappa.config.ts` and iterate on the callbacks until they match your use
case. Combine plugins to orchestrate complex capture flows without bloating the core CLI.
